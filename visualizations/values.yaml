# This is the list of regions that will be deployed. The 'path' value is required and should correspond directly to
# the name of the visualization configuration YAML files. If you wish to integrate your visualizations with the
# home page, you need to add the 'name' and 'fake' values (default: false), as shown below. The 'name' value
# allows you to set the exact display name for your region and the 'fake' value must be used to indicate when
# a region does not have a visualization. This may occur, for example, if you have visualizations for some cities
# and you represent them as subregions of a state, but you do not have a visualization for that state.
regions:
  - name: Germany
    path: germany
  - name: Saxony

# This is the list of origins that will be allowed to connect to the visualization server. Any domains used
# to view the visualizations should be listed here, otherwise the requests will be blocked.
